Peer feedback for Streamlit App:

Aaron Oustrich:
    Aaron noticed that some of my hover labels for my plots were capitalized while others were not. He also found an error where one of my plots was unable to show, and instead just had an error screen. I was glad he noticed that so I could fix it before I got more feedback! He liked the dataset filter I added to the end as well. Finally, he felt that the title for th app was set too low on the screen, and wasn't long enough to justify it being so low.

Andrew Bargeron:
    He really enjoyed using my app. He suggested I use some captions or descriptions by some of the plots to make things easier to track and follow. He had fun trying out a bunch of things, and it was really awesome to hear that the interactive elements of my app were enjoyable to use!

Non-classmate:
    When I finished my app I got really excited and sent the link to my dad and uncle, who love baseball just as much as I do. They really enjoyed looking at the different things, and I had a ton of fun showing them the different pieces. I was good to talk about by app with non-statistcians to see what elements may have been confusing.
