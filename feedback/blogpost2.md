Peer feedback for Blog Post 2:

Aaron Oustrich:
    Aaron liked a lot of the plots I had chosen and felt they were informative. He suggested changing some of the titles to be more uniform across plots, and to update some of the axis ticks to be more clear. 

Andrew Bargeron:
    Andrew also liked the choice in plots, but felt that there were some thigs that could use an explanation. He felt the different descriptions of the playoff tiers could use explaining so that someone who was less familiar with baseball would be able to understand.

Non-classmate:
    I had someone not in this class review the blog post for grammar errors and formatting, and also to get a non-statistician perspective on my post. My reviewer helped me with grammar a lot, but enjoyed looking at the plots, and felt the formatting was good. I was glad they were able to help me fix my grammar in the way they did.
