Peer feedback for Blog Post 1:

Aaron Oustrich:
    Aaron reviewed my blog post and helped me with my grammar and language used for some of the sections. He liked the separation for each of the code chunkds linked to the repo because it was easier to follow. 

Ty Hawkes:
    Ty enjoyed the post that I created and also liked the idea that I used links to clean up the post. He thought that maybe adding a chunk of example code could be good, and that fixing the grammar was also necessary. 

Andrew Bargeron:
    Andrew also liked the links to the different sections of my repo. He offered me a helpful link to a website to help clean up my grammar. 

Non-classmate:
    I had someone who wasn't enrolled in this class take a look at my first blog post. They cleaned up my grammar and language choice and made it a much easier to follow post, which I appreciated. They really enjoyed reading the different elements, and felt it as organized really well.
