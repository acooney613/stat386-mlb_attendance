Peer feedback for Blog Post 1:

Aaron Oustrich:
    Aaron reviewed my blog post and helped me with my grammar and language used for some of the sections. He liked the separation for each of the code chunkds linked to the repo because it was easier to follow. 

Ty Hawkes:
    Ty enjoyed the post that I created and also liked the idea that I used links to clean up the post. He thought that maybe adding a chunk of example code could be good, and that fixing the grammar was also necessary. 

Andrew Bargeron:
    Andrew also liked the links to the different sections of my repo. He offered me a helpful link to a website to help clean up my grammar. 

Non-classmate:
    I had someone who wasn't enrolled in this class take a look at my first blog post. They cleaned up my grammar and language choice and made it a much easier to follow post, which I appreciated. They really enjoyed reading the different elements, and felt it as organized really well. 

Peer feedback for Blog Post 2:

Aaron Oustrich:
    Aaron liked a lot of the plots I had chosen and felt they were informative. He suggested changing some of the titles to be more uniform across plots, and to update some of the axis ticks to be more clear. 

Andrew Bargeron:
    Andrew also liked the choice in plots, but felt that there were some thigs that could use an explanation. He felt the different descriptions of the playoff tiers could use explaining so that someone who was less familiar with baseball would be able to understand.

Non-classmate:
    I had someone not in this class review the blog post for grammar errors and formatting, and also to get a non-statistician perspective on my post. My reviewer helped me with grammar a lot, but enjoyed looking at the plots, and felt the formatting was good. I was glad they were able to help me fix my grammar in the way they did. 

Peer feedback for Streamlit App:

Aaron Oustrich:
    Aaron noticed that some of my hover labels for my plots were capitalized while others were not. He also found an error where one of my plots was unable to show, and instead just had an error screen. I was glad he noticed that so I could fix it before I got more feedback! He liked the dataset filter I added to the end as well. Finally, he felt that the title for th app was set too low on the screen, and wasn't long enough to justify it being so low.

Andrew Bargeron:
    He really enjoyed using my app. He suggested I use some captions or descriptions by some of the plots to make things easier to track and follow. He had fun trying out a bunch of things, and it was really awesome to hear that the interactive elements of my app were enjoyable to use!

Non-classmate:
    When I finished my app I got really excited and sent the link to my dad and uncle, who love baseball just as much as I do. They really enjoyed looking at the different things, and I had a ton of fun showing them the different pieces. I was good to talk about by app with non-statistcians to see what elements may have been confusing.
